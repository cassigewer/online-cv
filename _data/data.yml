career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
   Currently an honours' student in a BHSc Neuroscience at the Univeristy of the Witwatersrand. A woman dedicated to neuroscience, machine learning and the combination of the two. From cognitive to computational neuroscience, I seek to fill my days discovering the intricacies of the human neuronal composition. With a heart in academia, the Fourth Industrial Revolution and internationalisation - I integrate my love for brain science in whatever I do. I am a strong advocate for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work, and do so by attempting to synthesize my background in Humanities’ study with my current role in engineering, computer science, applied mathematics and neurobiology. 
   I dedicate my time toward instilling creative pathways within the world of science. I aspire and am open to gain as much experience as possible in order to be at the forefront of neuroscience.
   When I am not studying the human brain or artificial intelligence models, you will find me with a paintbrush in hand, at a community event or volunteering for a cause.

experiences:
    - role: Intern - Neuroscience Investigator and Machine Learning Engineer 
      time: 2019 - Present
      company: think3dots 
      details: This multidisciplinary internship was based in a biomedical engineering consultancy firm founded by Mr Adam Pantanowitz. Within the internship I am tasked to code, design and develop machine learning models within the healthcare sector. Use HTML, Django, Java and RubyRails to code a website and host it online. Develop cloud computing skills on amazon's AWS Sagemaker. Learning new skills, brain related software and programming languages is encouraged - as well as facing the prevalent issues within society such as the current COVID-19, medical data and health related neuroscience topics (brain-computer interface). All responsibilities and projects revolve around the healthcare and education spheres within South Africa with a greater goal of benefiting society by the use of technology 
    - role: Intern
      time: 20/11/2018 - 01/02/2018 
      company: MinPET - RC Physics, Univeristy of Johannesburg 
      details: Observed and actively participated in the formation of artificial intelligence models within the mining sector (MinPET). Surrounded by 8 physicists, Cassi learnt programming skills (Python specific), the practical use of machine learning in industry and, familiarised herself with various fields within computer science and engineering - these include cognitive computing, image recognition, nuclear medical technology and neural networks. Cassi mainly focused on the creation of convolutional neural networks (CNN) - spending much time investigating the foundations of these models. Primarily, focus was on implementing the above skills learnt within a neuroscientific context - studying AI models relating to Epilepsy, strokes, sleep disorders, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological phenomena. The internship highly benefited in the synthesis of both humanities and scientific study - allowing Cassi to put multidisciplinary interest into practise, resulting in various ideas that once compiled can benefit neurological patients.
